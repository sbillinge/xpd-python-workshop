exe1. import package by modifying .pth file

1. Locate the python library directory by 'pydoc site'. You can find the directory in FILE or PREFIXS+'/lib/python2.x/site-packges
2. create a new empty anyName.pth under that directory.
3. Add the path of your py03import directory to the .pth file
4. save and test if you can import the sayhello by "import exsayhello" or "from exsayhello import sayhello"

exe1. (optional) import package by modifying sys.path or PYTHONPATH
1. revert the changes to the .pth file (delete it or comment the path)
2. try use sys.path.append(path of your directory) to add path to sys.path
3. try change PYTHONPATH:
   a) linux: edit .bashrc and add EXPORT PYTHONPATH=yourpath:$PYTHONPATH, then start a new terminal and test
   b) windows: edit the PYTHONPATH in system variables (create it if not exists), then reboot and test

exe2. import modulars in directory

1. try 'from exelmath.quadraticroots import solveQuadraticRoots' and test
2. start a new python shell and try 'from exelmath import solveQuadraticRoots'
3. edit the __init__.py under exelmath
3. start a new shell and try 'from exelmath import solveQuadraticRoots' again

exe3. comments and docstrings

1. find some code without good comments, docstrings. It is better to work on some your own code because you will actully know what code does.
1. add your the code to the ex3codes with filename ex3_yourname.py, commit to repo
2. edit your code, add docstring, comments, change the format, etc.
3. commit your code to repo.
4. review the comments and docstrings with your group members and leave commits on google code web page.
